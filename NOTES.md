## Architecture Metrics
### Chainable: Always keep it possible to chain actions like $color->lighten()->extractChannel('r')->contrastRatio($blue)...
### Extensible: So the developer can add more color spaces, more named color sets, filters, ...

## todos:
### more flexibility for channel values (use float and percentage)
### more flexibility to convert from string (percentage values, float values, regex)
### Add more named colors (web, ...)
 - https://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Color/Dictionaries#The%20Dictionaries
### add some helper functions like rgbtohex(r, g, b) to work as standalone functions
### add palletes as a feature
### add generators: random color generator, random pallete generator, pallet generator having some info, ...
### Add filters and modifiers
 - Brighten / darken (absolute and relative).
 - Lighten / darken via HSL lightness.
 - Saturate / desaturate, contrast, invert.
 - Grayscale (multiple algorithms: average, luminosity, desaturate).
 - Hue rotate, temperature/tint (warm/cool shifts).
 - Channel-specific masks and adjustments (e.g., zero green, keep red only).
 - Predefined filters: sepia, posterize, threshold, gamma.
### Think about moving convertets like toRgb to separate classes or color space classes
### Use ColorSpaceRegistry as we did for filters and color names.
### Support for sRGB and optional color profiles (display-p3) as opt-in.
### Add more filters (invert, sepia, etc)
### Add these to analyzers
- equals() and almostEquals() with epsilon or ΔE tolerance.
- Perceptual distance: Delta E metrics (ΔE76, ΔE00) if Lab supported.
- luminance() (relative luminance), isLight() / isDark() (WCAG-friendly threshold).
- Contrast ratio and contrast checking (WCAG 2.1 thresholds).
### Add these to generators/extractors
- complement(), triadic(), analogous() color palette helpers.
- average() / mean() of multiple colors (weighted).
### use toInt() / toPackedInt() and fromPackedInt() for fast storage. for performance
### toCssVariable() helper
### Add more exceptions to the code and complete exception codes
### Move converters to Color spaces classes, so each color space knows how to convert to/from another color space. Like this, it will be easier to add custom color spaces and convert to/from it.
### There are color models for XYZ color space (LMS, xyY, YUV). We can also consider them.
### Can we create estimation for colors which are in one color space nut not in the other one?
### We can also consider creating Positive XYZ color space
### RGB has a model ACEScg / ACES2065-1
### consider CIELAB and CIELUV color spaces



##Libraries to look inside for inspiration

### new hierarchy of color models
Exactly — now we can use **dependency + subset** locally: a model can go under its parent **if it depends on it and has a smaller gamut**, even if the parent itself is not a subset of XYZ. Let’s construct the full hierarchy cleanly.

* **CIE XYZ**

  * **RGB** (subset, dependent on XYZ)

    * **CMY** (subset, dependent on RGB)

      * **CMYK** (subset, dependent on CMY)
    * **YPbPr** (subset, dependent on RGB)

      * **YCbCr** (subset, dependent on YPbPr)
      * **YUV** (subset, dependent on YPbPr)
      * **YIQ** (subset, dependent on YPbPr)
    * **HSV** (subset, dependent on RGB)
    * **HSL** (subset, dependent on RGB)
    * **HSI** (subset, dependent on RGB)
    * **HWB** (subset, dependent on RGB)
* **CIE Lab** (dependent on XYZ, not a subset, root for its own derivatives)

  * **LCH** (subset, dependent on Lab)
  * **Hunter Lab** (subset, dependent on Lab)
  * **DIN99** (subset, dependent on Lab)
* **CIE Luv** (dependent on XYZ, not a subset)
* **OKLab** (dependent on XYZ, not a subset)

  * **OKLCH** (subset, dependent on OKLab)
* **IPT** (dependent on LMS, not a subset)
* **LMS** (dependent on XYZ, not a subset)

  * **Opponent Color Model** (subset, dependent on LMS)
* **Munsell** (perceptual, independent)
* **NCS** (perceptual, independent)

✅ Notes:

* Subsets are indented only if **both dependency + smaller gamut** criteria are met.
* Perceptual reinterpretations (Lab, Luv, OKLab, Munsell, NCS) act as roots for their own subsets.
* Models like HSV/HSL are considered subsets of RGB because they cover the same RGB gamut in a geometric mapping.


Absolutely — below is a **global taxonomy of color models and color spaces** using your **“dependent + subset”** relation, and **clearly distinguishing between**:

* 🔹 **Color Model** — abstract mathematical representation of color components, independent of specific primaries/parameters
* 🔸 **Color Space** — a concrete instantiation of a model that *defines specific primaries, white points, ranges, and gamut*

Color spaces are listed under their respective model as **children**.

## 🧠 Notes on This Taxonomy

* **Models** are **bold** (abstract).
* **Spaces** are **bulleted with 🔸** under the model they concretize.
* Some cylindrical perceptual spaces (like LCH and OKLCH) are treated as distinct *spaces* or *sub‑models* because they reorder dimensions but share gamut with their base model. ([MDN Web Docs][1])
* Many additional specialized spaces exist (e.g., ACES, ProPhoto variants, film‑specific profiles); what’s included here are widely recognized standards. ([rxlab.guide][8])

---

## 🔍 Clarifications

* A **color model** becomes a **color space** only when **primaries, transfer functions, white points, gamuts, and numeric ranges** are defined. ([MDN Web Docs][1])
* The taxonomy shows **dependency + subset**: e.g., all RGB spaces are subsets within the RGB model, which itself is a subset of the visible gamut represented by XYZ.
* Perceptual models like Lab or OKLab are derived from XYZ but aren’t subsets in the gamut sense — their spaces are the actual representations used in practice. ([MDN Web Docs][1])
